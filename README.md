# IceCheck

## An app designed to keep you informed of ice levels on ponds or lakes during the winter!

Do you venture onto frozen ponds and lakes during the winter? IceCheck will keep you up to date on current ice levels, and to give you a platform to contribute valuable updates for fellow outdoor enthusiasts!

Here are some key features to get you started:
* Discover nearby ponds/lakes and explore recent updates of ice thickness. To view current updates, click on the red markers displayed on the map. Here you also have the option to create your own posts.
* If a pond or lake doesn't have any current updates, but you would like to make one, you can search for the desired location in the top left corner, and this will give you the option to make a post.
  
Happy exploring!
